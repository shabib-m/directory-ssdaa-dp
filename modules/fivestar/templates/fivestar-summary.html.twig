 * variables in this template:

 * indicates that the text should be shown but it has no value yet.
 *
 * Available variables
 * - average_rating: The desired average rating to display out of 100 (i.e. 80
 *    is 4 out of 5 stars), or NULL for not to show average rating.
 *    Defaults to NULL.
 * - votes: The total number of votes.
 * - stars: The number of stars being displayed.
 * - microdata: An additional data to show rating in the search engines
 *   results.
 * - user_rating: The rating set by the user on the enclosing entity as an
 *   integer 1..100, or NULL for not to show user rating. Defaults to NULL.
 * - average_rating_microdata: An additional data to show average rating
 *   in the search engines results.
 * - rating_count_microdata: An additional data to show the number of votes in
 *   the search engines results.
 * - average_stars: rounded rating to display (example: 4.0)
 * - output_type: a word indicating the desired output style. One of:
 *     - "user" when display user rating.
